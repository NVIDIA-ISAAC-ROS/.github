# Release Notes
## Isaac ROS DP (developer preview) June 30, 2022
### What's New
ROS2 Humble release of Isaac ROS with performance boost and new stereo perception functions including:
- packages for ROS2 Humble (Foxy deprecated) on Jetpack 5.0.1 DP
- support for Jetson Orin
- support for Isaac Sim 2022.1 *(Isaac SIM 2021.2 is deprecated)*
- `isaac_ros_nitros` implementing type adaptation & type negotiation features new to Humble boosting performance
- `isaac_ros_proximity_segmentation` for stereo vision detection of obstacles during navigation
- `isaac_ros_dnn_stereo_disparity` for stereo vision AI prediction of depth

### Limitations
There are known limitations with this release, documented below which may have additional details for workarounds in the troubleshooting section.
- Isaac SIM 2022.1 released in June 2022 will add support for Humble in September.  Incompatibilities exist performing SIL (software in the loop) simulation with Isaac ROS.
- Realsense drivers as-is do not support Humble, but can be modified to work
- `isaac_ros_nvblox` is untested with Nav2 on Humble
- Removed CenterPose support on Jetson
- `isaac_ros_ess` throws an error if using rosbag as input, and input topics are published after the node is started

## Isaac ROS EA3 (early access) March 23, 2022
### What's New
GTC 2022 release of Isaac ROS with new packages for vision based autonomous navigation including:
